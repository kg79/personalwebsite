				I was raised in League City, Tx, and was part of various organizations such as Boy Scouts, swimming, and 
				water polo clubs. I also studied music in lessons and on my own, writing music the majority of my youth.

				I spend my early adulthood working and going to college intermittenly, without finding the direction I was 
				looking for. It wasn't until August 2016 that I started studying Web Development and my path became clear. My initial inspiration came from wanting to code customizable musical instruments, and found the browser to be the most viable option using the Web Audio API. I studied 
				with a zeal and passion unparalleled by my peers because of the inspiration I had. I wrote mostly JavaScript,
				but familiarized myself with prominent languages in order to better understand the nature of programming, 
				and all the ideas and details are interesting to me.

				One of the most formative experiences in my study was when I attended Galvanize Web Development 
				Immersive in Austin. There I learned to use Linux, SQL, problem solving techniques, backend development using Node, in addition to sharpening my vanilla JavaScript. I also became aware of the language under 
				the hood, like how objects are stored in memory and that a stack and queue execute the event loop. It was one of my best experiences, but 
				unfortunately I dropped out 60% of the way through due to personal reasons. I remain dedicated and passionate 
				about Web Development and very optimistic about the future, in terms of how much farther I can go, and 
				how I can serve a higher purpose as part of a larger organization.

I was born in Austin, April 27, 1992, and was raised in League City Texas to an upper middle
class family. I was a part of various organizations 
as a child such as Boy Scouts, Swimming, and Water Polo. I've also studied and written music actively 
for a number of years. During that time I also studied literature and art in an 
attempt to learn more about creativity and the western canon in general.

I started studying Web Development in August, 2016. It began with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with some PHP/MYSQL, but I've studied at least the syntax of most of the modern languages in an attempt to better understand the nature of programming. I attended Galvanize Web Development Immersive program starting in February 2018, and learned more about vanilla JavaScript, Front End, Back End Development with Node, and the Linux environment. It was very interesting learning generic problem solving techniques, as well as the carnival of data structures used to execute JavaScript, in the form of the stack, the queue, and the heap.

I'm very optimistic about the future, given that I've been preparing for almost three years to get my first real job in Web Development. My original backround was in music, and I woke up and wrote music every single day that I could, every moment that was available. I use that same zeal to achieve my goals in programming, and the two aren't unrelated. Problem solving takes creativity, philosophy, intellect, tenacity, and style, as well as the right combination of all the components.
